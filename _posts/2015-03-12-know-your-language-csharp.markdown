Perhaps a 2 month hiatus from blog posts isn't exactly the best way to start a new year with the intention of blogging, but here I am...

For most of my career, I've worked with C# and .NET.  The past year and a half I've stepped away, focusing on project involving mostly JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.  This coming Monday I'll be starting a new job and stepping back into that world.  This presents the perfect opportunity to reacquaint myself with the language, as well as strengthen some places I may have been week in.

I won't be covering the basic stuff you see in most languages, also there are some things that are helpful additions but pretty basic so coverage of them may be brief.

## Overview

* 2.0
  * Generics
  * Anonymous Methods
  * Nullable Types
* 3.0
  * Lambda Expressions
  * Extension Methods
  * Expression Trees
  * Anonymous Types
  * LINQ
  * Implicit Typing
* 4.0
  * Late Binding (dynamic)
  * Named Arguments
  * Optional Parameters
* 5.0
  * Async features
  * Caller Information
