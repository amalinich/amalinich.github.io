This year, I'm finally making good on my goal to start (and update!) a technical blog.  I've definitely leveraged the blog content from many others (thank you!) over my career and if I can help or guide someone else even a little bit...that is great.  However, the main point of this platform is a chance for introspection...marking the triumphs and challenges I face in the coding world.
